next:
- start compiling statements in Scope?
- implement more Entity classes.
- Scope::State, and Scope in general.


constraint verification:
- for each variable, track timestamps for:
  - last access (read or write)
  - last write
  - last time constraints were verified
- at each access, verify constraints were not invalidated since the last verification


loops:
loop {
  state = compile(loop, originalState);
  if (state == originalState) break;
  originalState.mergeBranch(state);
}
