next:
- start compiling statements in Scope?
- implement more Entity classes.
- Seems like pointer values can't just be raw pointers because we need to compile multiple
  branches that don't all run in practice.  Instead they need to be identifiers, and Scope
  needs to maintain a map from these identifiers to their current known contents.


also:
- Fix Maybe<T&> operator bool!
