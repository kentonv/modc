next:
- Create a Port class and move all the port() methods to it.
  - This can keep track of any type parameters that need to become implicit parameters.
  - Need to think more about exporting vs. importing.  I guess exporting is unnecessary because
    we always import the constraints and then check them locally?
  - DataConstraints::port() use of FROM_CALLER doesn't make sense since that would only apply
    to exporting.
- start implementing Entity classes.
